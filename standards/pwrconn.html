<h2>EPL Power Connector</h2>
<p>
<h3>History</h3>
The Amphenol MiniHex-9 connector was adopted as the standard low voltage DC power connector some time in the early 1970s. At one time there were two conflicting pinouts, one for (Carlton Street numbers) Chamber I (Crist & Moxon) and another for Chamber II (Altmann).

<h2>Grass Power Connector</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
Grass has 2 historical power connectors. This is the more modern of them. The earlier one is from the vacuum tube age and included fun things like grid voltages.

<h3>Pinout</h3>
<p>
The connectors used are a 4-pin Jones 304 series, with pinout shown below as seen from the outside of the socket, or the inside of the plug. Note that the Circuit Ground which is the analog common is separate from the Chassis connection. They should remain separate in any equipment that you attach.
This drawing is from the back of the female.
